King’s Ely makes every effort to provide a safe, educational environment. 
ICT is provided for pupils and staff to conduct research and communicate with others. 
ICT Users must remember that access is a privilege, not a right, and requires responsibility. 
All pupils must therefore agree to the following conditions of use: 
- During lesson times, the school ICT systems (including the internet, email, mobile technologies) must only be used for 
school purposes; 
- Mobile devices must not be used in the dining hall, refectory or whilst walking; 
- Software must not be downloaded or installed on school technologies;
- ICT passwords should not be shared with other users and King's Ely users should only log onto the network with their 
own username and password; 
- ICT communications must be polite, responsible and sensible; 
- King's Ely users are responsible for their behaviour when using the internet. This includes the resources accessed and
the language used; 
- King's Ely users should not give out any personal information (name, phone number or address); 
- King's Ely users must not deliberately browse, download, upload or forward material that could be considered offensive
or illegal. If a pupil accidentally comes across any such material, it must be reported immediately to a member of 
staff. Users bringing personal devices into school must ensure there is no inappropriate or illegal content on the devices; 
- King's Ely users must ensure that online activity (both in school and outside of school) will not cause King’s Ely, 
the staff, pupils or others distress or bring the school community into disrepute; 
- The privacy and ownership of others’ work online must be respected at all times

The internet provides access to sites located all over the world and users (and parents, if the user is under 18) must 
understand that King’s Ely does not control the content of the information on these sites. Some of the information 
available is controversial and, sometimes, offensive. King’s Ely does not condone the use of such materials and will use
its best endeavours to prevent access to all such inappropriate materials. King’s Ely reserves the right to view any 
file stored on its network or computers and to monitor use of the network. There are also filters on internet material 
and attempt must not be made to bypass the internet filtering system.

<i>
Breaking any of the above rules may result in a 
temporary or permanent ban on ICT use. Additional disciplinary action may be added in line with existing practice on 
inappropriate language or behaviour. If applicable, police or local authorities may be involved with legal consequences.
